# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a classification model to predict whether an individual is at risk of **heart disease** using the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**. It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using appropriate metrics.

---

##  Objective

- Predict the risk of heart disease based on health-related attributes.
- Use classification algorithms like **Logistic Regression** or **Decision Tree**.
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **ROC-AUC**.
- Identify the most important features that influence the prediction.

##  Dataset

**UCI Heart Disease Dataset**

### Features Include:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
- Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
- Oldpeak (ST depression)
- Slope, Ca, Thal, etc.
- **Target**: 1 (disease), 0 (no disease)

##  Tasks Performed

### 1️ Data Cleaning
- Check for and handle missing/null values
- Encode categorical variables (if any)
- Normalize or scale features (if needed)

### 2️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions and correlations
- Use heatmaps, bar charts, histograms, etc.
- Analyze relationships between features and the target variable

### 3️ Model Training
- Use **Logistic Regression** or **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20)

### 4 Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve and AUC Score**
- **Feature Importance** (especially for Decision Tree)
